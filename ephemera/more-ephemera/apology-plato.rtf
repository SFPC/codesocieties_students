\f0\b \cf2 Socrates' Defense
\f1\b0 \'a0\
\
How you have felt, O men of Athens, at hearing the speeches of\'a0my accusers, I cannot tell; but I know that their persuasive words almost\'a0made me forget who I was - such was the effect of them; and yet they have\'a0hardly spoken a word of truth. But many as their falsehoods were, there\'a0was one of them which quite amazed me; - I mean when they told you to be\'a0upon your guard, and not to let yourselves be deceived by the force of\'a0my eloquence. They ought to have been ashamed of saying this, because theywere sure to be detected as soon as I opened my lips and displayed my deficiency;\'a0they certainly did appear to be most shameless in saying this, unless by\'a0the force of eloquence they mean the force of truth; for then I do indeed\'a0admit that I am eloquent. But in how different a way from theirs! Well,\'a0as I was saying, they have hardly uttered a word, or not more than a word,\'a0of truth; but you shall hear from me the whole truth: not, however, delivered\'a0after their manner, in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases.\'a0No indeed! but I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at\'a0the moment; for I am certain that this is right, and that at my time of\'a0life I ought not to be appearing before you, O men of Athens, in the character\'a0of a juvenile orator - let no one expect this of me. And I must beg of\'a0you to grant me one favor, which is this - If you hear me using the same\'a0words in my defence which I have been in the habit of using, and which\'a0most of you may have heard in the agora, and at the tables of the money-changers,\'a0or anywhere else, I would ask you not to be surprised at this, and not\'a0to interrupt me. For I am more than seventy years of age, and this is\'a0the first time that I have ever appeared in a court of law, and I am quite\'a0a stranger to the ways of the place; and therefore I would have you regard\'a0me as if I were really a stranger, whom you would excuse if he spoke in\'a0his native tongue, and after the fashion of his country; - that I think\'a0is not an unfair request. Never mind the manner, which may or may not be\'a0good; but think only of the justice of my cause, and give heed to that:\'a0let the judge decide justly and the speaker speak truly.\'a0\
\
And first, I have to reply to the older charges and to my first\'a0accusers, and then I will go to the later ones. For I have had many accusers,\'a0who accused me of old, and their false charges have continued during many\'a0years; and I am more afraid of them than of Anytus and his associates,\'a0who are dangerous, too, in their own way. But far more dangerous are these,\'a0who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with\'a0their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about\'a0the heaven above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse\'a0appear the better cause. These are the accusers whom I dread; for they\'a0are the circulators of this rumor, and their hearers are too apt to fancy\'a0that speculators of this sort do not believe in the gods. And they are\'a0many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they made them\'a0in days when you were impressible - in childhood, or perhaps in youth -\'a0and the cause when heard went by default, for there was none to answer.And, hardest of all, their names I do not know and cannot tell; unless\'a0in the chance of a comic poet. But the main body of these slanderers who\'a0from envy and malice have wrought upon you - and there are some of them\'a0who are convinced themselves, and impart their convictions to others -\'a0all these, I say, are most difficult to deal with; for I cannot have them\'a0up here, and examine them, and therefore I must simply fight with shadows\'a0in my own defence, and examine when there is no one who answers. I willask you then to assume with me, as I was saying, that my opponents are\'a0of two kinds - one recent, the other ancient; and I hope that you will\'a0see the propriety of my answering the latter first, for these accusations\'a0you heard long before the others, and much oftener.\'a0\
\
Well, then, I will make my defence, and I will endeavor in the\'a0short time which is allowed to do away with this evil opinion of me which\'a0you have held for such a long time; and I hope I may succeed, if this be\'a0well for you and me, and that my words may find favor with you. But I know\'a0that to accomplish this is not easy - I quite see the nature of the task.\'a0Let the event be as God wills: in obedience to the law I make my\'a0defence.\'a0\
\
I will begin at the beginning, and ask what the accusation is which\'a0has given rise to this slander of me, and which has encouraged Meletus\'a0to proceed against me. What do the slanderers say? They shall be my prosecutors,\'a0and I will sum up their words in an affidavit. "Socrates is an evil-doer,\'a0and a curious person, who searches into things under the earth and in heaven,\'a0and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he teaches the aforesaid\'a0doctrines to others." That is the nature of the accusation, and that is\'a0what you have seen yourselves in the comedy of Aristophanes; who has introduced\'a0a man whom he calls Socrates, going about and saying that he can walk in\'a0the air, and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which I do\'a0not pretend to know either much or little - not that I mean to say anything\'a0disparaging of anyone who is a student of natural philosophy. I should\'a0be very sorry if Meletus could lay that to my charge. But the simple truth\'a0is, O Athenians, that I have nothing to do with these studies. Very many\'a0of those here present are witnesses to the truth of this, and to them I\'a0appeal. Speak then, you who have heard me, and tell your neighbors whether\'a0any of you have ever known me hold forth in few words or in many upon matters\'a0of this sort. ... You hear their answer. And from what they say of this\'a0you will be able to judge of the truth of the rest.\'a0\
\
As little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher,\'a0and take money; that is no more true than the other. Although, if a man\'a0is able to teach, I honor him for being paid. There is Gorgias of Leontium,\'a0and Prodicus of Ceos, and Hippias of Elis, who go the round of the cities,\'a0and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens, by\'a0whom they might be taught for nothing, and come to them, whom they not\'a0only pay, but are thankful if they may be allowed to pay them. There is\'a0actually a Parian philosopher residing in Athens, of whom I have heard;\'a0and I came to hear of him in this way: - I met a man who has spent a world\'a0of money on the Sophists, Callias the son of Hipponicus, and knowing that\'a0he had sons, I asked him: "Callias," I said, "if your two sons were foals\'a0or calves, there would be no difficulty in finding someone to put over\'a0them; we should hire a trainer of horses or a farmer probably who would\'a0improve and perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence; but\'a0as they are human beings, whom are you thinking of placing over them? Is\'a0there anyone who understands human and political virtue? You must have\'a0thought about this as you have sons; is there anyone?" "There is," he said.\'a0"Who is he?" said I, "and of what country? and what does he charge?" "Evenus\'a0the Parian," he replied; "he is the man, and his charge is five minae."\'a0Happy is Evenus, I said to myself, if he really has this wisdom, and teaches\'a0at such a modest charge. Had I the same, I should have been very proudand conceited; but the truth is that I have no knowledge of the\'a0kind.\'a0\
\
I dare say, Athenians, that someone among you will reply, "Why\'a0is this, Socrates, and what is the origin of these accusations of you:\'a0for there must have been something strange which you have been doing? All\'a0this great fame and talk about you would never have arisen if you had been\'a0like other men: tell us, then, why this is, as we should be sorry to judge\'a0hastily of you." Now I regard this as a fair challenge, and I will endeavor\'a0to explain to you the origin of this name of "wise," and of this evil fame.\'a0Please to attend then. And although some of you may think I am joking,\'a0I declare that I will tell you the entire truth. Men of Athens, this reputation\'a0of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I possess. If you ask\'a0me what kind of wisdom, I reply, such wisdom as is attainable by man, for\'a0to that extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise; whereas the persons\'a0of whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom, which I may fail to describe,\'a0because I have it not myself; and he who says that I have, speaks falsely,\'a0and is taking away my character. And here, O men of Athens, I must beg\'a0you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant. For\'a0the word which I will speak is not mine. I will refer you to a witness\'a0who is worthy of credit, and will tell you about my wisdom - whether I\'a0have any, and of what sort - and that witness shall be the god of Delphi.\'a0You must have known Chaerephon; he was early a friend of mine, and also\'a0a friend of yours, for he shared in the exile of the people, and returned\'a0with you. Well, Chaerephon, as you know, was very impetuous in all his\'a0doings, and he went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether\'a0- as I was saying, I must beg you not to interrupt - he asked the oracle\'a0to tell him whether there was anyone wiser than I was, and the Pythian\'a0prophetess answered that there was no man wiser. Chaerephon is dead himself,\'a0but his brother, who is in court, will confirm the truth of this\'a0story.\'a0\
\
Why do I mention this? Because I am going to explain to you why\'a0I have such an evil name. When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What\'a0can the god mean? and what is the interpretation of this riddle? for I\'a0know that I have no wisdom, small or great. What can he mean when he says\'a0that I am the wisest of men? And yet he is a god and cannot lie; that would\'a0be against his nature. After a long consideration, I at last thought of\'a0a method of trying the question. I reflected that if I could only find\'a0a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god with a refutation in\'a0my hand. I should say to him, "Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but\'a0you said that I was the wisest." Accordingly I went to one who had the\'a0reputation of wisdom, and observed to him - his name I need not mention;\'a0he was a politician whom I selected for examination - and the result was\'a0as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that\'a0he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser\'a0still by himself; and I went and tried to explain to him that he thought\'a0himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he\'a0hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard\'a0me. So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do\'a0not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good,\'a0I am better off than he is - for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows.\'a0I neither know nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then,\'a0I seem to have slightly the advantage of him. Then I went to another, who\'a0had still higher philosophical pretensions, and my conclusion was exactly\'a0the same. I made another enemy of him, and of many others besides\'a0him.\'a0\
\
After this I went to one man after another, being not unconscious\'a0of the enmity which I provoked, and I lamented and feared this: but necessity\'a0was laid upon me - the word of God, I thought, ought to be considered first.\'a0And I said to myself, Go I must to all who appear to know, and find out\'a0the meaning of the oracle. And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I\'a0swear! - for I must tell you the truth - the result of my mission was just\'a0this: I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish;\'a0and that some inferior men were really wiser and better. I will tell you\'a0the tale of my wanderings and of the "Herculean" labors, as I may call\'a0them, which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. When\'a0I left the politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all\'a0sorts. And there, I said to myself, you will be detected; now you willfind out that you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took\'a0them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked\'a0what was the meaning of them - thinking that they would teach me something.\'a0Will you believe me? I am almost ashamed to speak of this, but still I\'a0must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked\'a0better about their poetry than they did themselves. That showed me in an\'a0instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius\'a0and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many\'a0fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. And the poets appeared\'a0to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon the\'a0strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men\'a0in other things in which they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving\'a0myself to be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to\'a0the politicians.\'a0\
\
At last I went to the artisans, for I was conscious that I knew\'a0nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things;\'a0and in this I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which\'a0I was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. But I\'a0observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets;\'a0because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts\'a0of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom - therefore\'a0I asked myself on behalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I\'a0was, neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in\'a0both; and I made answer to myself and the oracle that I was better off\'a0as I was.\'a0\
\
This investigation has led to my having many enemies of the worst\'a0and most dangerous kind, and has given occasion also to many calumnies,\'a0and I am called wise, for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess\'a0the wisdom which I find wanting in others: but the truth is, O men of Athens,\'a0that God only is wise; and in this oracle he means to say that the wisdom\'a0of men is little or nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is only\'a0using my name as an illustration, as if he said, He, O men, is the wisest,who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing. And\'a0so I go my way, obedient to the god, and make inquisition into the wisdom\'a0of anyone, whether citizen or stranger, who appears to be wise; and if\'a0he is not wise, then in vindication of the oracle I show him that he is\'a0not wise; and this occupation quite absorbs me, and I have no time to give\'a0either to any public matter of interest or to any concern of my own, but\'a0I am in utter poverty by reason of my devotion to the\'a0god.\'a0\
\
There is another thing: - young men of the richer classes, who\'a0have not much to do, come about me of their own accord; they like to hear\'a0the pretenders examined, and they often imitate me, and examine others\'a0themselves; there are plenty of persons, as they soon enough discover,\'a0who think that they know something, but really know little or nothing:\'a0and then those who are examined by them instead of being angry with themselves\'a0are angry with me: This confounded Socrates, they say; this villainous\'a0misleader of youth! - and then if somebody asks them, Why, what evil does\'a0he practise or teach? they do not know, and cannot tell; but in order that\'a0they may not appear to be at a loss, they repeat the ready-made charges\'a0which are used against all philosophers about teaching things up in the\'a0clouds and under the earth, and having no gods, and making the worse appear\'a0the better cause; for they do not like to confess that their pretence of\'a0knowledge has been detected - which is the truth: and as they are numerousand ambitious and energetic, and are all in battle array and have persuasive\'a0tongues, they have filled your ears with their loud and inveterate calumnies.\'a0And this is the reason why my three accusers, Meletus and Anytus and Lycon,\'a0have set upon me; Meletus, who has a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets;\'a0Anytus, on behalf of the craftsmen; Lycon, on behalf of the rhetoricians:\'a0and as I said at the beginning, I cannot expect to get rid of this mass\'a0of calumny all in a moment. And this, O men of Athens, is the truth and\'a0the whole truth; I have concealed nothing, I have dissembled nothing. And\'a0yet I know that this plainness of speech makes them hate me, and what istheir hatred but a proof that I am speaking the truth? - this is the occasion\'a0and reason of their slander of me, as you will find out either in this\'a0or in any future inquiry.\'a0\
\
I have said enough in my defence against the first class of my\'a0accusers; I turn to the second class, who are headed by Meletus, that good\'a0and patriotic man, as he calls himself. And now I will try to defend myself\'a0against them: these new accusers must also have their affidavit read. What\'a0do they say? Something of this sort: - That Socrates is a doer of evil,\'a0and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the\'a0state, and has other new divinities of his own. That is the sort of charge;\'a0and now let us examine the particular counts. He says that I am a doer\'a0of evil, who corrupt the youth; but I say, O men of Athens, that Meletus\'a0is a doer of evil, and the evil is that he makes a joke of a serious matter,\'a0and is too ready at bringing other men to trial from a pretended zeal and\'a0interest about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest.\'a0And the truth of this I will endeavor to prove.\'a0\
\
Come hither, Meletus, and let me ask a question of you. You think\'a0a great deal about the improvement of youth?\'a0\
\
Yes, I do.\'a0\
\
Tell the judges, then, who is their improver; for you must know,\'a0as you have taken the pains to discover their corrupter, and are citing\'a0and accusing me before them. Speak, then, and tell the judges who their\'a0improver is. Observe, Meletus, that you are silent, and have nothing to\'a0say. But is not this rather disgraceful, and a very considerable proof\'a0of what I was saying, that you have no interest in the matter? Speak up,\'a0friend, and tell us who their improver is.\'a0\
\
The laws.\'a0\
\
But that, my good sir, is not my meaning. I want to know who the\'a0person is, who, in the first place, knows the laws.\'a0\
\
The judges, Socrates, who are present in court.\'a0\
\
What do you mean to say, Meletus, that they are able to instruct\'a0and improve youth?\'a0\
\
Certainly they are.\'a0\
\
What, all of them, or some only and not others?\'a0\
\
All of them.\'a0\
\
By the goddess Here, that is good news! There are plenty of improvers,\'a0then. And what do you say of the audience, - do they improve\'a0them?\'a0\
\
Yes, they do.\'a0\
\
And the senators?\'a0\
\
Yes, the senators improve them.\'a0\
\
But perhaps the members of the citizen assembly corrupt them? -\'a0or do they too improve them?\'a0\
\
They improve them.\'a0\
\
Then every Athenian improves and elevates them; all with the exception\'a0of myself; and I alone am their corrupter? Is that what you\'a0affirm?\'a0\
\
That is what I stoutly affirm.\'a0\
\
I am very unfortunate if that is true. But suppose I ask you a\'a0question: Would you say that this also holds true in the case of horses?\'a0Does one man do them harm and all the world good? Is not the exact opposite\'a0of this true? One man is able to do them good, or at least not many; -\'a0the trainer of horses, that is to say, does them good, and others who have\'a0to do with them rather injure them? Is not that true, Meletus, of horses,\'a0or any other animals? Yes, certainly. Whether you and Anytus say yes or\'a0no, that is no matter. Happy indeed would be the condition of youth if\'a0they had one corrupter only, and all the rest of the world were their improvers.\'a0And you, Meletus, have sufficiently shown that you never had a thought\'a0about the young: your carelessness is seen in your not caring about matters\'a0spoken of in this very indictment.\'a0\
\
And now, Meletus, I must ask you another question: Which is better,\'a0to live among bad citizens, or among good ones? Answer, friend, I say;\'a0for that is a question which may be easily answered. Do not the good do\'a0their neighbors good, and the bad do them evil?\'a0\
\
Certainly.\'a0\
\
And is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited\'a0by those who live with him? Answer, my good friend; the law requires you\'a0to answer - does anyone like to be injured?\'a0\
\
Certainly not.\'a0\
\
And when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth,\'a0do you allege that I corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally?\'a0\
\
Intentionally, I say.\'a0\
\
But you have just admitted that the good do their neighbors good,\'a0and the evil do them evil. Now is that a truth which your superior wisdom\'a0has recognized thus early in life, and am I, at my age, in such darkness\'a0and ignorance as not to know that if a man with whom I have to live is\'a0corrupted by me, I am very likely to be harmed by him, and yet I corrupt\'a0him, and intentionally, too; - that is what you are saying, and of that\'a0you will never persuade me or any other human being. But either I do not\'a0corrupt them, or I corrupt them unintentionally, so that on either view\'a0of the case you lie. If my offence is unintentional, the law has no cognizance\'a0of unintentional offences: you ought to have taken me privately, and warned\'a0and admonished me; for if I had been better advised, I should have left\'a0off doing what I only did unintentionally - no doubt I should; whereas\'a0you hated to converse with me or teach me, but you indicted me in this\'a0court, which is a place not of instruction, but of punishment.\'a0\
\
I have shown, Athenians, as I was saying, that Meletus has no care\'a0at all, great or small, about the matter. But still I should like to know,\'a0Meletus, in what I am affirmed to corrupt the young. I suppose you mean,\'a0as I infer from your indictment, that I teach them not to acknowledge the\'a0gods which the state acknowledges, but some other new divinities or spiritual\'a0agencies in their stead. These are the lessons which corrupt the youth,\'a0as you say.\'a0\
\
Yes, that I say emphatically.\'a0\
\
Then, by the gods, Meletus, of whom we are speaking, tell me and\'a0the court, in somewhat plainer terms, what you mean! for I do not as yet\'a0understand whether you affirm that I teach others to acknowledge some gods,\'a0and therefore do believe in gods and am not an entire atheist - this you\'a0do not lay to my charge; but only that they are not the same gods which\'a0the city recognizes - the charge is that they are different gods. Or, do\'a0you mean to say that I am an atheist simply, and a teacher of\'a0atheism?\'a0\
\
I mean the latter - that you are a complete\'a0atheist.\'a0\
\
That is an extraordinary statement, Meletus. Why do you say that?\'a0Do you mean that I do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon, which\'a0is the common creed of all men?\'a0\
\
I assure you, judges, that he does not believe in them; for he\'a0says that the sun is stone, and the moon earth.\'a0\
\
Friend Meletus, you think that you are accusing Anaxagoras; and\'a0you have but a bad opinion of the judges, if you fancy them ignorant to\'a0such a degree as not to know that those doctrines are found in the books\'a0of Anaxagoras the Clazomenian, who is full of them. And these are the doctrines\'a0which the youth are said to learn of Socrates, when there are not unfrequently\'a0exhibitions of them at the theatre (price of admission one drachma at the\'a0most); and they might cheaply purchase them, and laugh at Socrates if he\'a0pretends to father such eccentricities. And so, Meletus, you really think\'a0that I do not believe in any god?\'a0\
\
I swear by Zeus that you believe absolutely in none at\'a0all.\'a0\
\
You are a liar, Meletus, not believed even by yourself. For I cannot\'a0help thinking, O men of Athens, that Meletus is reckless and impudent,\'a0and that he has written this indictment in a spirit of mere wantonness\'a0and youthful bravado. Has he not compounded a riddle, thinking to try me?\'a0He said to himself: - I shall see whether this wise Socrates will discover\'a0my ingenious contradiction, or whether I shall be able to deceive him and\'a0the rest of them. For he certainly does appear to me to contradict himself\'a0in the indictment as much as if he said that Socrates is guilty of not\'a0believing in the gods, and yet of believing in them - but this surely is\'a0a piece of fun.\'a0\
\
I should like you, O men of Athens, to join me in examining what\'a0I conceive to be his inconsistency; and do you, Meletus, answer. And I\'a0must remind you that you are not to interrupt me if I speak in my accustomed\'a0manner.\'a0\
\
Did ever man, Meletus, believe in the existence of human things,\'a0and not of human beings? ... I wish, men of Athens, that he would answer,\'a0and not be always trying to get up an interruption. Did ever any man believe\'a0in horsemanship, and not in horses? or in flute-playing, and not in flute-players?\'a0No, my friend; I will answer to you and to the court, as you refuse to\'a0answer for yourself. There is no man who ever did. But now please to answer\'a0the next question: Can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies,and not in spirits or demigods?\'a0\
\
He cannot.\'a0\
\
I am glad that I have extracted that answer, by the assistance\'a0of the court; nevertheless you swear in the indictment that I teach and\'a0believe in divine or spiritual agencies (new or old, no matter for that);\'a0at any rate, I believe in spiritual agencies, as you say and swear in the\'a0affidavit; but if I believe in divine beings, I must believe in spirits\'a0or demigods; - is not that true? Yes, that is true, for I may assume that\'a0your silence gives assent to that. Now what are spirits or demigods? are\'a0they not either gods or the sons of gods? Is that true?\'a0\
\
Yes, that is true.\'a0\
\
But this is just the ingenious riddle of which I was speaking:\'a0the demigods or spirits are gods, and you say first that I don't believe\'a0in gods, and then again that I do believe in gods; that is, if I believe\'a0in demigods. For if the demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods, whether\'a0by the Nymphs or by any other mothers, as is thought, that, as all men\'a0will allow, necessarily implies the existence of their parents. You might\'a0as well affirm the existence of mules, and deny that of horses and asses.\'a0Such nonsense, Meletus, could only have been intended by you as a trial\'a0of me. You have put this into the indictment because you had nothing real\'a0of which to accuse me. But no one who has a particle of understanding will\'a0ever be convinced by you that the same man can believe in divine and superhuman\'a0things, and yet not believe that there are gods and demigods and\'a0heroes.\'a0\
\
I have said enough in answer to the charge of Meletus: any elaborate\'a0defence is unnecessary; but as I was saying before, I certainly have many\'a0enemies, and this is what will be my destruction if I am destroyed; of\'a0that I am certain; - not Meletus, nor yet Anytus, but the envy and detraction\'a0of the world, which has been the death of many good men, and will probably\'a0be the death of many more; there is no danger of my being the last of\'a0them.\'a0\
\
Someone will say: And are you not ashamed, Socrates, of a course\'a0of life which is likely to bring you to an untimely end? To him I may fairly\'a0answer: There you are mistaken: a man who is good for anything ought not\'a0to calculate the chance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether\'a0in doing anything he is doing right or wrong - acting the part of a good\'a0man or of a bad. Whereas, according to your view, the heroes who fell at\'a0Troy were not good for much, and the son of Thetis above all, who altogether\'a0despised danger in comparison with disgrace; and when his goddess mother\'a0said to him, in his eagerness to slay Hector, that if he avenged his companionPatroclus, and slew Hector, he would die himself - "Fate," as she said,\'a0"waits upon you next after Hector"; he, hearing this, utterly despised\'a0danger and death, and instead of fearing them, feared rather to live in\'a0dishonor, and not to avenge his friend. "Let me die next," he replies,\'a0"and be avenged of my enemy, rather than abide here by the beaked ships,\'a0a scorn and a burden of the earth." Had Achilles any thought of death and\'a0danger? For wherever a man's place is, whether the place which he has chosen\'a0or that in which he has been placed by a commander, there he ought to remain\'a0in the hour of danger; he should not think of death or of anything, but\'a0of disgrace. And this, O men of Athens, is a true saying.\'a0\
\
Strange, indeed, would be my conduct, O men of Athens, if I who,\'a0when I was ordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at Potidaea\'a0and Amphipolis and Delium, remained where they placed me, like any other\'a0man, facing death; if, I say, now, when, as I conceive and imagine, God\'a0orders me to fulfil the philosopher's mission of searching into myself\'a0and other men, I were to desert my post through fear of death, or any other\'a0fear; that would indeed be strange, and I might justly be arraigned incourt for denying the existence of the gods, if I disobeyed the oracle\'a0because I was afraid of death: then I should be fancying that I was wise\'a0when I was not wise. For this fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom,\'a0and not real wisdom, being the appearance of knowing the unknown; since\'a0no one knows whether death, which they in their fear apprehend to be the\'a0greatest evil, may not be the greatest good. Is there not here conceit\'a0of knowledge, which is a disgraceful sort of ignorance? And this is the\'a0point in which, as I think, I am superior to men in general, and in which\'a0I might perhaps fancy myself wiser than other men, - that whereas I know\'a0but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know\'a0that injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil\'a0and dishonorable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather\'a0than a certain evil. And therefore if you let me go now, and reject the\'a0counsels of Anytus, who said that if I were not put to death I ought not\'a0to have been prosecuted, and that if I escape now, your sons will all be\'a0utterly ruined by listening to my words - if you say to me, Socrates, this\'a0time we will not mind Anytus, and will let you off, but upon one condition,\'a0that are to inquire and speculate in this way any more, and that if you\'a0are caught doing this again you shall die; - if this was the condition\'a0on which you let me go, I should reply: Men of Athens, I honor and love\'a0you; but I shall obey God rather than you, and while I have life and strength\'a0I shall never cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy, exhorting\'a0anyone whom I meet after my manner, and convincing him, saying: O my friend,\'a0why do you who are a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of Athens,\'a0care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and\'a0reputation, and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement\'a0of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? Are you not ashamed\'a0of this? And if the person with whom I am arguing says: Yes, but I do care;\'a0I do not depart or let him go at once; I interrogate and examine and cross-examine\'a0him, and if I think that he has no virtue, but only says that he has, Ireproach him with undervaluing the greater, and overvaluing the less. And\'a0this I should say to everyone whom I meet, young and old, citizen and alien,\'a0but especially to the citizens, inasmuch as they are my brethren. For this\'a0is the command of God, as I would have you know; and I believe that to\'a0this day no greater good has ever happened in the state than my service\'a0to the God. For I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young\'a0alike, not to take thought for your persons and your properties, but first\'a0and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell\'a0you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue come money\'a0and every other good of man, public as well as private. This is my teaching,\'a0and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth, my influence is ruinous\'a0indeed. But if anyone says that this is not my teaching, he is speaking\'a0an untruth. Wherefore, O men of Athens, I say to you, do as Anytus bids\'a0or not as Anytus bids, and either acquit me or not; but whatever you do,\'a0know that I shall never alter my ways, not even if I have to die many\'a0times.\'a0\
\
Men of Athens, do not interrupt, but hear me; there was an agreement\'a0between us that you should hear me out. And I think that what I am going\'a0to say will do you good: for I have something more to say, at which you\'a0may be inclined to cry out; but I beg that you will not do this. I would\'a0have you know that, if you kill such a one as I am, you will injure yourselves\'a0more than you will injure me. Meletus and Anytus will not injure me: they\'a0cannot; for it is not in the nature of things that a bad man should injure\'a0a better than himself. I do not deny that he may, perhaps, kill him, or\'a0drive him into exile, or deprive him of civil rights; and he may imagine,\'a0and others may imagine, that he is doing him a great injury: but in that\'a0I do not agree with him; for the evil of doing as Anytus is doing - of\'a0unjustly taking away another man's life - is greater far. And now, Athenians,\'a0I am not going to argue for my own sake, as you may think, but for yours,\'a0that you may not sin against the God, or lightly reject his boon by condemning\'a0me. For if you kill me you will not easily find another like me, who, if\'a0I may use such a ludicrous figure of speech, am a sort of gadfly, given\'a0to the state by the God; and the state is like a great and noble steed\'a0who is tardy in his motions owing to his very size, and requires to be\'a0stirred into life. I am that gadfly which God has given the state and all\'a0day long and in all places am always fastening upon you, arousing and persuading\'a0and reproaching you. And as you will not easily find another like me, I\'a0would advise you to spare me. I dare say that you may feel irritated at\'a0being suddenly awakened when you are caught napping; and you may think\'a0that if you were to strike me dead, as Anytus advises, which you easily\'a0might, then you would sleep on for the remainder of your lives, unless\'a0God in his care of you gives you another gadfly. And that I am given to\'a0you by God is proved by this: - that if I had been like other men, I should\'a0not have neglected all my own concerns, or patiently seen the neglect ofthem during all these years, and have been doing yours, coming to you individually,\'a0like a father or elder brother, exhorting you to regard virtue; this I\'a0say, would not be like human nature. And had I gained anything, or if my\'a0exhortations had been paid, there would have been some sense in that: but\'a0now, as you will perceive, not even the impudence of my accusers dares\'a0to say that I have ever exacted or sought pay of anyone; they have no witness\'a0of that. And I have a witness of the truth of what I say; my poverty is\'a0a sufficient witness.\'a0\
\
Someone may wonder why I go about in private, giving advice and\'a0busying myself with the concerns of others, but do not venture to come\'a0forward in public and advise the state. I will tell you the reason of this.\'a0You have often heard me speak of an oracle or sign which comes to me, and\'a0is the divinity which Meletus ridicules in the indictment. This sign I\'a0have had ever since I was a child. The sign is a voice which comes to me\'a0and always forbids me to do something which I am going to do, but never\'a0commands me to do anything, and this is what stands in the way of my being\'a0a politician. And rightly, as I think. For I am certain, O men of Athens,\'a0that if I had engaged in politics, I should have perished long ago and\'a0done no good either to you or to myself. And don't be offended at my telling\'a0you the truth: for the truth is that no man who goes to war with you or\'a0any other multitude, honestly struggling against the commission of unrighteousness\'a0and wrong in the state, will save his life; he who will really fight for\'a0the right, if he would live even for a little while, must have a private\'a0station and not a public one.\'a0\
\
I can give you as proofs of this, not words only, but deeds, which\'a0you value more than words. Let me tell you a passage of my own life, which\'a0will prove to you that I should never have yielded to injustice from any\'a0fear of death, and that if I had not yielded I should have died at once.\'a0I will tell you a story - tasteless, perhaps, and commonplace, but nevertheless\'a0true. The only office of state which I ever held, O men of Athens, was\'a0that of senator; the tribe Antiochis, which is my tribe, had the presidency\'a0at the trial of the generals who had not taken up the bodies of the slain\'a0after the battle of Arginusae; and you proposed to try them all together,\'a0which was illegal, as you all thought afterwards; but at the time I was\'a0the only one of the Prytanes who was opposed to the illegality, and I gave\'a0my vote against you; and when the orators threatened to impeach and arrest\'a0me, and have me taken away, and you called and shouted, I made up my mind\'a0that I would run the risk, having law and justice with me, rather than\'a0take part in your injustice because I feared imprisonment and death. This\'a0happened in the days of the democracy. But when the oligarchy of the Thirty\'a0was in power, they sent for me and four others into the rotunda, and bade\'a0us bring Leon the Salaminian from Salamis, as they wanted to execute him.\'a0This was a specimen of the sort of commands which they were always giving\'a0with the view of implicating as many as possible in their crimes; and then\'a0I showed, not in words only, but in deed, that, if I may be allowed to\'a0use such an expression, I cared not a straw for death, and that my only\'a0fear was the fear of doing an unrighteous or unholy thing. For the strong\'a0arm of that oppressive power did not frighten me into doing wrong; and\'a0when we came out of the rotunda the other four went to Salamis and fetched\'a0Leon, but I went quietly home. For which I might have lost my life, had\'a0not the power of the Thirty shortly afterwards come to an end. And to this\'a0many will witness.\'a0\
\
Now do you really imagine that I could have survived all these\'a0years, if I had led a public life, supposing that like a good man I had\'a0always supported the right and had made justice, as I ought, the first\'a0thing? No, indeed, men of Athens, neither I nor any other. But I have been\'a0always the same in all my actions, public as well as private, and never\'a0have I yielded any base compliance to those who are slanderously termed\'a0my disciples or to any other. For the truth is that I have no regular\'a0disciples: but if anyone likes to come and hear me while I am pursuing\'a0my mission, whether he be young or old, he may freely come. Nor do I converse\'a0with those who pay only, and not with those who do not pay; but anyone,\'a0whether he be rich or poor, may ask and answer me and listen to my words;\'a0and whether he turns out to be a bad man or a good one, that cannot be\'a0justly laid to my charge, as I never taught him anything. And if anyone\'a0says that he has ever learned or heard anything from me in private which\'a0all the world has not heard, I should like you to know that he is speaking\'a0an untruth.\'a0\
\
But I shall be asked, Why do people delight in continually conversing\'a0with you? I have told you already, Athenians, the whole truth about this:\'a0they like to hear the cross-examination of the pretenders to wisdom; there\'a0is amusement in this. And this is a duty which the God has imposed upon\'a0me, as I am assured by oracles, visions, and in every sort of way in which\'a0the will of divine power was ever signified to anyone. This is true, O\'a0Athenians; or, if not true, would be soon refuted. For if I am really corrupting\'a0the youth, and have corrupted some of them already, those of them who have\'a0grown up and have become sensible that I gave them bad advice in the days\'a0of their youth should come forward as accusers and take their revenge;\'a0and if they do not like to come themselves, some of their relatives, fathers,\'a0brothers, or other kinsmen, should say what evil their families suffered\'a0at my hands. Now is their time. Many of them I see in the court. There\'a0is Crito, who is of the same age and of the same deme with myself; and\'a0there is Critobulus his son, whom I also see. Then again there is Lysanias\'a0of Sphettus, who is the father of Aeschines - he is present; and also there\'a0is Antiphon of Cephisus, who is the father of Epignes; and there are the\'a0brothers of several who have associated with me. There is Nicostratus the\'a0son of Theosdotides, and the brother of Theodotus (now Theodotus himself\'a0is dead, and therefore he, at any rate, will not seek to stop him); and\'a0there is Paralus the son of Demodocus, who had a brother Theages; and Adeimantus\'a0the son of Ariston, whose brother Plato is present; and Aeantodorus, who\'a0is the brother of Apollodorus, whom I also see. I might mention a great\'a0many others, any of whom Meletus should have produced as witnesses in the\'a0course of his speech; and let him still produce them, if he has forgotten\'a0- I will make way for him. And let him say, if he has any testimony of\'a0the sort which he can produce. Nay, Athenians, the very opposite is the\'a0truth. For all these are ready to witness on behalf of the corrupter, of\'a0the destroyer of their kindred, as Meletus and Anytus call me; not the\'a0corrupted youth only - there might have been a motive for that - but theiruncorrupted elder relatives. Why should they too support me with their\'a0testimony? Why, indeed, except for the sake of truth and justice, and because\'a0they know that I am speaking the truth, and that Meletus is\'a0lying.\'a0\
\
Well, Athenians, this and the like of this is nearly all the defence\'a0which I have to offer. Yet a word more. Perhaps there may be someone who\'a0is offended at me, when he calls to mind how he himself, on a similar or\'a0even a less serious occasion, had recourse to prayers and supplications\'a0with many tears, and how he produced his children in court, which was a\'a0moving spectacle, together with a posse of his relations and friends; whereas\'a0I, who am probably in danger of my life, will do none of these things.Perhaps this may come into his mind, and he may be set against me, and\'a0vote in anger because he is displeased at this. Now if there be such a\'a0person among you, which I am far from affirming, I may fairly reply to\'a0him: My friend, I am a man, and like other men, a creature of flesh and\'a0blood, and not of wood or stone, as Homer says; and I have a family, yes,\'a0and sons. O Athenians, three in number, one of whom is growing up, and\'a0the two others are still young; and yet I will not bring any of them hither\'a0in order to petition you for an acquittal. And why not? Not from any self-will\'a0or disregard of you. Whether I am or am not afraid of death is another\'a0question, of which I will not now speak. But my reason simply is that I\'a0feel such conduct to be discreditable to myself, and you, and the whole\'a0state. One who has reached my years, and who has a name for wisdom, whether\'a0deserved or not, ought not to debase himself. At any rate, the world has\'a0decided that Socrates is in some way superior to other men. And if thoseamong you who are said to be superior in wisdom and courage, and any other\'a0virtue, demean themselves in this way, how shameful is their conduct! I\'a0have seen men of reputation, when they have been condemned, behaving in\'a0the strangest manner: they seemed to fancy that they were going to suffer\'a0something dreadful if they died, and that they could be immortal if you\'a0only allowed them to live; and I think that they were a dishonor to the\'a0state, and that any stranger coming in would say of them that the most\'a0eminent men of Athens, to whom the Athenians themselves give honor and\'a0command, are no better than women. And I say that these things ought not\'a0to be done by those of us who are of reputation; and if they are done,\'a0you ought not to permit them; you ought rather to show that you are more\'a0inclined to condemn, not the man who is quiet, but the man who gets up\'a0a doleful scene, and makes the city ridiculous.\'a0\
\
But, setting aside the question of dishonor, there seems to be\'a0something wrong in petitioning a judge, and thus procuring an acquittal\'a0instead of informing and convincing him. For his duty is, not to make a\'a0present of justice, but to give judgment; and he has sworn that he will\'a0judge according to the laws, and not according to his own good pleasure;\'a0and neither he nor we should get into the habit of perjuring ourselves\'a0- there can be no piety in that. Do not then require me to do what I consider\'a0dishonorable and impious and wrong, especially now, when I am being tried\'a0for impiety on the indictment of Meletus. For if, O men of Athens, by force\'a0of persuasion and entreaty, I could overpower your oaths, then I should\'a0be teaching you to believe that there are no gods, and convict myself,\'a0in my own defence, of not believing in them. But that is not the case;\'a0for I do believe that there are gods, and in a far higher sense than that\'a0in which any of my accusers believe in them. And to you and to God I commit\'a0my cause, to be determined by you as is best for you and\'a0me.\'a0\

\f0\b \cf2 Socrates' Proposal for his Sentence
\f1\b0 \'a0\
\
There are many reasons why I am not grieved, O men of Athens, at\'a0the vote of condemnation. I expected it, and am only surprised that the\'a0votes are so nearly equal; for I had thought that the majority against\'a0me would have been far larger; but now, had thirty votes gone over to the\'a0other side, I should have been acquitted. And I may say that I have escaped\'a0Meletus. And I may say more; for without the assistance of Anytus and Lycon,\'a0he would not have had a fifth part of the votes, as the law requires, in\'a0which case he would have incurred a fine of a thousand drachmae, as is\'a0evident.\'a0\
\
And so he proposes death as the penalty. And what shall I propose\'a0on my part, O men of Athens? Clearly that which is my due. And what is\'a0that which I ought to pay or to receive? What shall be done to the man\'a0who has never had the wit to be idle during his whole life; but has been\'a0careless of what the many care about - wealth, and family interests, and\'a0military offices, and speaking in the assembly, and magistracies, and plots,\'a0and parties. Reflecting that I was really too honest a man to follow in\'a0this way and live, I did not go where I could do no good to you or to myself;\'a0but where I could do the greatest good privately to everyone of you, thither\'a0I went, and sought to persuade every man among you that he must look to\'a0himself, and seek virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private interests,\'a0and look to the state before he looks to the interests of the state; and\'a0that this should be the order which he observes in all his actions. What\'a0shall be done to such a one? Doubtless some good thing, O men of Athens,\'a0if he has his reward; and the good should be of a kind suitable to him.\'a0What would be a reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, who\'a0desires leisure that he may instruct you? There can be no more fitting\'a0reward than maintenance in the Prytaneum, O men of Athens, a reward which\'a0he deserves far more than the citizen who has won the prize at Olympia\'a0in the horse or chariot race, whether the chariots were drawn by two horses\'a0or by many. For I am in want, and he has enough; and he only gives youthe appearance of happiness, and I give you the reality. And if I am to\'a0estimate the penalty justly, I say that maintenance in the Prytaneum is\'a0the just return.\'a0\
\
Perhaps you may think that I am braving you in saying this, as\'a0in what I said before about the tears and prayers. But that is not the\'a0case. I speak rather because I am convinced that I never intentionally\'a0wronged anyone, although I cannot convince you of that - for we have had\'a0a short conversation only; but if there were a law at Athens, such as there\'a0is in other cities, that a capital cause should not be decided in one day,\'a0then I believe that I should have convinced you; but now the time is too\'a0short. I cannot in a moment refute great slanders; and, as I am convinced\'a0that I never wronged another, I will assuredly not wrong myself. I will\'a0not say of myself that I deserve any evil, or propose any penalty. Why\'a0should I? Because I am afraid of the penalty of death which Meletus proposes?\'a0When I do not know whether death is a good or an evil, why should I propose\'a0a penalty which would certainly be an evil? Shall I say imprisonment? And\'a0why should I live in prison, and be the slave of the magistrates of the\'a0year - of the Eleven? Or shall the penalty be a fine, and imprisonment\'a0until the fine is paid? There is the same objection. I should have to lie\'a0in prison, for money I have none, and I cannot pay. And if I say exile\'a0(and this may possibly be the penalty which you will affix), I must indeed\'a0be blinded by the love of life if I were to consider that when you, who\'a0are my own citizens, cannot endure my discourses and words, and have found\'a0them so grievous and odious that you would fain have done with them, others\'a0are likely to endure me. No, indeed, men of Athens, that is not very likely.\'a0And what a life should I lead, at my age, wandering from city to city,\'a0living in ever-changing exile, and always being driven out! For I am quite\'a0sure that into whatever place I go, as here so also there, the young men\'a0will come to me; and if I drive them away, their elders will drive me out\'a0at their desire: and if I let them come, their fathers and friends will\'a0drive me out for their sakes.\'a0\
\
Someone will say: Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue,\'a0and then you may go into a foreign city, and no one will interfere with\'a0you? Now I have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to\'a0this. For if I tell you that this would be a disobedience to a divine command,\'a0and therefore that I cannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I\'a0am serious; and if I say again that the greatest good of man is daily to\'a0converse about virtue, and all that concerning which you hear me examining\'a0myself and others, and that the life which is unexamined is not worth living\'a0- that you are still less likely to believe. And yet what I say is true,\'a0although a thing of which it is hard for me to persuade you. Moreover,\'a0I am not accustomed to think that I deserve any punishment. Had I money\'a0I might have proposed to give you what I had, and have been none the worse.\'a0But you see that I have none, and can only ask you to proportion the fine\'a0to my means. However, I think that I could afford a minae, and therefore\'a0I propose that penalty; Plato, Crito, Critobulus, and Apollodorus, my friends\'a0here, bid me say thirty minae, and they will be the sureties. Well then,\'a0say thirty minae, let that be the penalty; for that they will be ample\'a0security to you.\'a0\

\f0\b \cf2 Socrates' Comments on his Sentence
\f1\b0 \'a0\
\
Not much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return for the evil\'a0name which you will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that\'a0you killed Socrates, a wise man; for they will call me wise even although\'a0I am not wise when they want to reproach you. If you had waited a little\'a0while, your desire would have been fulfilled in the course of nature. For\'a0I am far advanced in years, as you may perceive, and not far from death.\'a0I am speaking now only to those of you who have condemned me to death.\'a0And I have another thing to say to them: You think that I was convicted\'a0through deficiency of words - I mean, that if I had thought fit to leave\'a0nothing undone, nothing unsaid, I might have gained an acquittal. Not so;\'a0the deficiency which led to my conviction was not of words - certainly\'a0not. But I had not the boldness or impudence or inclination to address\'a0you as you would have liked me to address you, weeping and wailing and\'a0lamenting, and saying and doing many things which you have been accustomed\'a0to hear from others, and which, as I say, are unworthy of me. But I thought\'a0that I ought not to do anything common or mean in the hour of danger: nor\'a0do I now repent of the manner of my defence, and I would rather die having\'a0spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and live. For neither\'a0in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death.\'a0For often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his\'a0arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and\'a0in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing\'a0to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding\'a0death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death.\'a0I am old and move slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my\'a0accusers are keen and quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness,\'a0has overtaken them. And now I depart hence condemned by you to suffer the\'a0penalty of death, and they, too, go their ways condemned by the truth to\'a0suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my award\'a0- let them abide by theirs. I suppose that these things may be regarded\'a0as fated, - and I think that they are well.\'a0\
\
And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to\'a0you; for I am about to die, and that is the hour in which men are gifted\'a0with prophetic power. And I prophesy to you who are my murderers, that\'a0immediately after my death punishment far heavier than you have inflicted\'a0on me will surely await you. Me you have killed because you wanted to escape\'a0the accuser, and not to give an account of your lives. But that will not\'a0be as you suppose: far otherwise. For I say that there will be more accusers\'a0of you than there are now; accusers whom hitherto I have restrained: and\'a0as they are younger they will be more severe with you, and you will be\'a0more offended at them. For if you think that by killing men you can avoid\'a0the accuser censuring your lives, you are mistaken; that is not a way of\'a0escape which is either possible or honorable; the easiest and noblest way\'a0is not to be crushing others, but to be improving yourselves. This is the\'a0prophecy which I utter before my departure, to the judges who have condemned\'a0me.\'a0\
\
Friends, who would have acquitted me, I would like also to talk\'a0with you about this thing which has happened, while the magistrates are\'a0busy, and before I go to the place at which I must die. Stay then awhile,\'a0for we may as well talk with one another while there is time. You are my\'a0friends, and I should like to show you the meaning of this event which\'a0has happened to me. O my judges - for you I may truly call judges - I should\'a0like to tell you of a wonderful circumstance. Hitherto the familiar oracle\'a0within me has constantly been in the habit of opposing me even about trifles,\'a0if I was going to make a slip or error about anything; and now as you see\'a0there has come upon me that which may be thought, and is generally believed\'a0to be, the last and worst evil. But the oracle made no sign of opposition,\'a0either as I was leaving my house and going out in the morning, or when\'a0I was going up into this court, or while I was speaking, at anything which\'a0I was going to say; and yet I have often been stopped in the middle ofa speech; but now in nothing I either said or did touching this matter\'a0has the oracle opposed me. What do I take to be the explanation of this?\'a0I will tell you. I regard this as a proof that what has happened to me\'a0is a good, and that those of us who think that death is an evil are in\'a0error. This is a great proof to me of what I am saying, for the customary\'a0sign would surely have opposed me had I been going to evil and not to\'a0good.\'a0\
\
Let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great\'a0reason to hope that death is a good, for one of two things: - either death\'a0is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there\'a0is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another. Now if\'a0you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep\'a0of him who is undisturbed even by the sight of dreams, death will be an\'a0unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select the night in which his\'a0sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the\'a0other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days\'a0and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly\'a0than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man, but\'a0even the great king, will not find many such days or nights, when compared\'a0with the others. Now if death is like this, I say that to die is gain;\'a0for eternity is then only a single night. But if death is the journey to\'a0another place, and there, as men say, all the dead are, what good, O my\'a0friends and judges, can be greater than this? If indeed when the pilgrim\'a0arrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice\'a0in this world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment\'a0there, Minos and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sonsof God who were righteous in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth\'a0making. What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and\'a0Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and\'a0again. I, too, shall have a wonderful interest in a place where I can converse\'a0with Palamedes, and Ajax the son of Telamon, and other heroes of old, who\'a0have suffered death through an unjust judgment; and there will be no small\'a0pleasure, as I think, in comparing my own sufferings with theirs. Above\'a0all, I shall be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge;\'a0as in this world, so also in that; I shall find out who is wise, and who\'a0pretends to be wise, and is not. What would not a man give, O judges, to\'a0be able to examine the leader of the great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus\'a0or Sisyphus, or numberless others, men and women too! What infinite delight\'a0would there be in conversing with them and asking them questions! For in\'a0that world they do not put a man to death for this; certainly not. For\'a0besides being happier in that world than in this, they will be immortal,\'a0if what is said is true.\'a0\
\
Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know this\'a0of a truth - that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after\'a0death. He and his are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own approaching\'a0end happened by mere chance. But I see clearly that to die and be released\'a0was better for me; and therefore the oracle gave no sign. For which reason\'a0also, I am not angry with my accusers, or my condemners; they have done\'a0me no harm, although neither of them meant to do me any good; and for this\'a0I may gently blame them.\'a0\
\
Still I have a favor to ask of them. When my sons are grown up,\'a0I would ask you, O my friends, to punish them; and I would have you trouble\'a0them, as I have troubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or anything,\'a0more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something when they are\'a0really nothing, - then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring\'a0about that for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something\'a0when they are really nothing. And if you do this, I and my sons will have\'a0received justice at your hands.\'a0\
\
The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways - I to die,\'a0and you to live. Which is better God only knows.\'a0\
